            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the
            user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be
            focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and
            tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important. <br>

            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
            intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
            text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
            list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the
            main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content
            management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

            Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as
            personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These software applications are
            designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be
            pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side
            or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a web
            browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware
            specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each
            of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013
            analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members (including
            the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app developers.</p>
